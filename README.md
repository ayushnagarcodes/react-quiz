## Project Setup

Make sure `node` and `npm` are installed. Run the following command in the terminal:

1. `npm i` or `npm install`
2. `npm start` or `npm run start`
3. Open a new terminal and enter `npm run server` command.
4. Read the comment inside `useEffect` in `src/App.js` to configure the fetch request for `json-server` node package.
